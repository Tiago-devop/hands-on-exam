Final Question: Why should BRFConsulting consider you?

I'm a self-taught professional who seeks zeal for the code, delivering tasks on time
requested, I have a great curiosity to look for new things in the subject that I am developing,
I know when to ask for help when necessary and before seeking any help I try to research first
and extinguish all possibilities.
I know I have a lot to learn and I hope to be able to learn and grow as a professional by being part of
from the BRFConsulting team
